## About Me

I'm transitioning into ML engineering with hands-on experience building real-time AI systems. My background in pure mathematics (PhD in Algebraic Geometry) gives me a strong foundation for solving complex ML problems. I've built a low-latency speech translation pipeline and contribute to formal verification projects in Lean4.

**Actively seeking ML/AI Engineering roles in Rome or remote. Available to start before February 2026.**

## Technical Skills

**ML & AI Frameworks**
PyTorch • TensorFlow • Hugging Face • XGBoost • SHAP

**Programming & Infrastructure**
Python • Git • Linux • Docker • Google Cloud Platform

**Data & APIs**
MySQL • PostgreSQL • FastAPI • Streamlit

**Specialized Skills**
- Real-time speech translation and NLP
- Financial ML (sentiment analysis, fraud detection)
- Real-time audio processing (sounddevice, VAD, streaming)
- Mathematical modeling and optimization
- Formal verification (Lean4)
